General

What is Pneumonia

Pneumonia is an infection which inflames the alveoli which causes it to potentially fill with fluid or pus. 

The initial causes of pneumonia are vast & are grouped by cause. 

Types of pneumonia:

Bacterial pneumonia
Caused by various bacteria
Most common - Streptococcus Pneumoniae
Occurs when body is weakened
Bacteria works its way into the lungs
More serious symptoms
Can be sudden or gradual

Viral pneumonia
Caused by viruses
Responsible for ⅓ of cases
More likely to get bacterial pneumonia if you have viral pneumonia
Gradually shows symptoms

Mycoplasma Pneumonia
Also called atypical pneumonia
Caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Causes mild pneumonia

Others:
Rest are less common and caused by other infections such as fungi






Effects:
The accumulation of pus is actually the body’s response to infection in the lungs. The pus contains many blood elements including groups of WBC called Neutrophils and groups of plasma proteins called Opsonins. These are important to fighting off infection. However, it can become dangerous as Neutrophils make toxic products that while useful in killing microbes, can also damage the lungs. The accumulation of plasma proteins results in the build up of fluid in the lungs (aka pulmonary edema) This makes the gas exchange much more difficult and for the body to function as this function is essential. This is also the cause of many of the symptoms experienced by those who have pneumonia.

Pneumonia primarily affects the respiratory system. More specifically, the alveoli. The bacteria enters through your airways into your lungs. The infection causes inflammation in the alveoli causing it to fill with fluid or pus. This leads to symptoms such as coughing & trouble breathing. The gas exchange becomes more difficult and can lead to respiratory failure if it becomes more severe and is not treated.

Specialized Cells that could be affected include Alveolar macrophages which are innate immune cells in the alveoli which can become overwhelmed by infections. Epithelial cells & Type II alveolar cells which may become damaged or destroyed which can lead to increased risk of bacterial infections. 

Diagnosis
The most common form of diagnosis is for your doctor to ask you about your symptoms, how these symptoms originated, possible exposures, & medical history.

They will also do a physical exam by listening to your lungs with a stethoscope. If you have pneumonia, your lungs may make crackling, bubbling, & rumbling sounds when inhaling.

Should your doctor suspect you have pneumonia, they may recommend tests. These tests include:

Blood Tests: Confirms infection & potentially identifies the germ causing it.

Chest X-ray: White spots in your lungs shown in an x-ray called infiltrates can identify an infection. It may also determine whether there are any complications such as abscesses or pleural effusions (fluid surrounding the lungs).

Pulse Oximetry: Measures Oxygen in blood which can see if Pneumonia is preventing your lungs from moving oxygen into your bloodstream.

Sputum test: A sample of mucus is taken in order to identify source of infection.
You may be asked to do more tests if you’re a high risk patient. These include:

CT scan: Better view of lungs & look for abscesses or complications

Arterial blood gas test: Measures amount of oxygen in a blood sample. More accurate than a pulse oximetry.

Pleural Fluid Culture: Removes a small amount of fluid from tissues around the lung to identify bacteria causing Pneumonia.

Bronchoscopy: A procedure to look into the lungs’ airways. Often used when treatment isn’t effective & doctors want to check whether anything else is affecting airways. Also used to take fluid samples or a biopsy of lung tissue.
