## Cell Theory & Organelles

### Characteristics Of Living Things

**Genes**: All living things inherit genes + traits from their parents. This is also known as heredity

**Reproduction**: All living things reproduce sexually (ʘ ʖ̯ ʘ) or asexually

**Adaptation & Evolution**: All living things can adapt to their environment

**Metabolism**: All living things need energy in order to carry out the chemical reactions in the body

**Irritability**: All living things feel stimuli (such as pain)

**Cells**: All living things are composed of cells

### Cell Theory

Biology is a science based on **cell theory**.

**Cell theory** states that:
- All living things are made of cells
- The cell is the simplest unit that can carry out all life processes
- All cells reproduce and are reproduced from other cells

## Prokaryotes & Eukaryotes

All living things are made up of cells. They can either be simple or complex.

There are 2 types of cells.
- Cells that contain a nucleus and other **organelles**, each surrounded by a thin membrane.
- Cells that don't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.

### Prokaryotes

**Prokaryotes** are simply lifeforms. They are single celled and lack a nucleus.

An example of a prokaryote is bacterium.

### Eukaryotes

**Eukaryotes** are complex organisms. They can be single or multi-celled organisms. They have a nucleus.

Eukaryotes are much largers than prokaryote cells and are often 10-1000x larger.

Examples of eukaryotes are plants and animals.

## Function & Structure Of Cells

All cells perform certain basic activities to stay alive. These activities are performed by **organelles**. **Organelles** are a specialized cell part. Each organelle has a specific function. They work together to meet the needs of the cell. Plant and animal cells have many common structures. Hoevever, plant cells have organelles that animal cells do not.

### Organelle List
| Organelle                 | Function                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cytoplasm                 | Fluid surrounding organelles inside the cell membrane. It's mostly water & stores substances the cell needs. It's where many chemical reactions take place.                                |
| Cell Membrane             | A flexible double-layered support structure surrounding the cell. Allows substances in and out of the cell.                                                                                |
| Nucleus                   | A spherical structure in the cell. Where genetic information which controls all activities is stored in chromosomes.                                                                       |
| Mitochrondria             | The powerhouse of the cell. (╰（‵□′）╯) It makes energy available to the cell via cellular respiration (needs O<sub>2</sub>). Enzymes in the **mitochondria** convert glucose into energy. |
| Golgi Bodies              | Collects and processes materials to be removed from the cell. Produces mucus.                                                                                                              |
