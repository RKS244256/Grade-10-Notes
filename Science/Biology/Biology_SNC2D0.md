## Cell Theory & Organelles

### Characteristics Of Living Things

**Genes**: All living things inherit genes + traits from their parents. This is also known as heredity

**Reproduction**: All living things reproduce sexually (ʘ ʖ̯ ʘ) or asexually

**Adaptation & Evolution**: All living things can adapt to their environment

**Metabolism**: All living things need energy in order to carry out the chemical reactions in the body

**Irritability**: All living things feel stimuli (such as pain)

**Cells**: All living things are composed of cells

### Cell Theory

Biology is a science based on **cell theory**.

**Cell theory** states that:
- All living things are made of cells
- The cell is the simplest unit that can carry out all life processes
- All cells reproduce & are reproduced from other cells

## Prokaryotes & Eukaryotes

All living things are made up of cells. They can either be simple or complex.

There are 2 types of cells.
- Cells that contain a nucleus & other **organelles**, each surrounded by a thin membrane.
- Cells that don't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles.

### Prokaryotes

**Prokaryotes** are simply lifeforms. They are single celled & lack a nucleus.

An example of a prokaryote is bacterium.

![Prokaryote](Prokaryote.png)

### Eukaryotes

**Eukaryotes** are complex organisms. They can be single or multi-celled organisms. They have a nucleus.

Eukaryotes are much largers than prokaryote cells & are often 10-1000x larger.

Examples of eukaryotes are plants & animals.

## Function & Structure Of Cells

All cells perform certain basic activities to stay alive. These activities are performed by **organelles**. **Organelles** are a specialized cell part. Each organelle has a specific function. They work together to meet the needs of the cell. Plant & animal cells have many common structures. Hoevever, plant cells have organelles that animal cells do not.

## Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is a series of events which take place in a cell as it grows & divides. The resulting **daughter cells** will then begin their own round of the cell cycle.

![Cell Cycle](Cell_Cycle_Diagram.jpg)

In a eukaryotic cell, the cell cycle is divided into 2 major phases. The **Interphase** & **Mitosis**.

### Why divide?
As a cell gets bigger, it's harder to transport materials and waste around the cell. Cells need to transport these materials and waste in and out of the cell quickly unless it wants to die. If the cell becomes larger, it becomes inefficient and can poison itself as a result. Therefore, it divides.

### Interphase

During **Interphase**, the cell grows & makes copies of its DNA. In order to first divide a cell, it needs to go through interphase, This preparation happens in 3 steps.

There are checks throughout these phases to ensure that organelles grow properly, DNA is copied properly, the cell has grown enough, etc.

#### G<sub>1</sub> Phase
During the **G<sub>1</sub> phase** (aka the first gap phase), the cell grows larger, copies organelles and kaes the molecular building blocks it requires in the later steps.

#### S Phase
In the **S phase**, the DNA in the cell's nucleus is copied and synthesized. It also duplicates a microtubule-organizing structure called the **centrosome**. The centrosomes which help separate DNA during **Mitosis**. 

#### G<sub>2</sub> Phase
During the **G<sub>2</sub> Phase** (aka the second gap phase), the cell grows more, makes organelles, and begins to reorganize its contents for mitosis. This phase ends when mitosis begins.

![Interphase](Interphase.webp)

### Mitotic Phase

During the **Mitotic Phase** (aka the "M" phase), the cell divides its copied DNA and cytoplasm to make 2 new cells. The mitotic phase involves 2 devision-related processes: **Mitosis** & **Cytokinesis**.

#### Mitosis

In **Mitosis**, the DNA in the cell condenses into visible chromosomes and is pulled apart by the **mitotic spindle** ( a specialized structure made of microtubules). Mitosis takes place in 4 phases: **Prophase**, **Metaphase**, **Anaphase** & **Telophase**.

The goal of mitosis is to ensure each daughter cell gets a perfect set of chromosomes. Cells that don't have enough or too many chromsomes don't function well. So when cells undergo mitosis, they split their chromosomes into their daughter cells equally in an organized series of steps.

##### Prophase
In the early prophase, the cell starts to break down some structures and build up others. This sets the stage for division of the chromosomes. Chromosomes will start to condense which makes them easier to pull apart while also making them visible. The **mitotic spindle** begins to form. The spindle is made of microtubles. It's job to organize chromosomes and move them around during mitosis. The spindle grows between the centrosomes as they move apart. The nucleolus disappears. 
![Early Prophase](Early_Prophase.png)

In the late prophase, the mitotic spindle begins to capture and organize the chromosomes. THe chromosomes become even more condensed. The nuclear envelope breaks down and the mitotic spindle grows more. The microtublues start to capture chromosomes.

![Late Prophase](Late_Prophase.png)
Microtubules bind to chromosomes at the **kinetochore** (a patch of protein found on the centromere of each chromatid). **Centromeres** are the regions of DNA where sister chromatides are most tightly connected.
![Mitotic Spindle](Spindle.png)

##### Metaphase

In **Metaphase**, the spindle has captured all the chromosomes and lined them at the equator of the cell. Before moving to the **Anaphase**, the cell will check to makes sure that all the chromosomes are where they should be at the equator. This is called the **spindle chackpoint** & helps ensure that the chromotids will split evenly between the daughter cells when they separate. If this check is not fulfilled, the cell will simply halt the cycle until it can be corrected.

![Metaphase](Metaphase.png)

##### Anaphase

During **Anaphase**, the sister chrmatids separate from each other and are pulled towards the opposite ends of the cell. All these processes are driven by motor proties (molecular machines that can "walk" along microtubule tracks and carry a cargo). In mitosis, motor proteins carry chromosomes or microtubles as they "walk".
![Anaphase](Anaphase.png)
##### Telophase

In the **Telophase**, the cell is nearly done dividing & starts to re-establish its normal strucutres as **Cytokinesis** takes place. The mitotic spindle breaks down into its building blocks. 2 nuclei form for each set of chromosomes. The nucleoli and nuclear membranes reappear. The chromosomes begin to decondense and return to their normal form.
![Telophase](Telophase.png)
#### Cytokinesis

**Cytokinesis** is the division of the cytoplasm in order to form 2 new cells. It overlaps with the final stages of mitosis. It either starts in the **Anaphase** or **Telophase** depnding on the cell and will finish shortly after the telophase. This happens differently depending on whether the cell is a plant or animal cell.

In animal cells, the cytokinesis pinches the cell in 2 like a drawstring bag. The "drawstring" is a band of filaments made of protein called actin and the crease is known as the cleavage furrow.

Plant cells cannot be divided like this as they have a cell wall. Instead, a structure called the cell plate forms down the middle of the cell which splits & separates the 2 daughter cells.

![Cytokinesis](Cytokinesis.png)

The cycle is thus completed and the 2 daughter cells will continue the cycle.
