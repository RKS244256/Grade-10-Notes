### Failure of the League Of Nations

The **League Of Nations** was an international organization created after WW1 with the goal of providing a place to settle conflicts peacefully. This would hopefully discourage aggression. avoid future wars & encourage international cooperation.

#### Why did it fail?

**Not All Countries Joined**
- Less than 50% of the world joined the League Of Nations
- The USA did not join & the Soviet Union was excluded which meant the League Of Nations did not have the support of 2 of the world's superpowers at the time.
