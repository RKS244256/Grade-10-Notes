## Main Causes

Remember the Acronym **FART**

| Letter | Cause                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| F      | Failure of the League Of Nations |
| A      | Appeasement                      |
| R      | Rise of Fascism & Dictatorships  |
| T      | Treaty Of Versailles                                 |

### Failure of the League Of Nations

The **League Of Nations** was an international organization created after WW1 with the goal of providing a place to settle conflicts peacefully. This would hopefully discourage aggression. avoid future wars & encourage international cooperation.

#### Why did it fail?

**Not All Countries Joined**
- Less than 50% of the world joined the League Of Nations.
- The USA did not join & the Soviet Union was excluded which meant the League Of Nations did not have the support of 2 of the world's superpowers at the time.

**No Power**
- Most common form of retaliation were sanctions.
- Could not do much towards aggressive countries.

**No Army**
- No army.
- Countries were not required to provide an army.

**Unable To Act Quickly**
- Needed to reach a consensus before acting
- Recommendations were not binding

#### Biggest Failures

The LoN failed to deal with:

| Country | Failures                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Italy   | Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia & Albania |
| Japan   | Hirohito's invasion of Manchuria, China    |
| Germany | Germany re-arming the military             |
| Germany | Announcing conscription                    |
| Germany | Entering the Rhineland (Neutral Territory) |
| Germany | Reuniting with Austria                     |
| Germany | Invading Czechoslovakia                                           |

All 3 countries defied the LoN without any repercussions.

### Appeasement

**Appeasement** - Giving people what they want to avoid conflict.

Appeasement allowed aggressive nations to expand without any resistance.

Here's examples by Germany:

| Actions Taken By Germany             | Why Appeasement?                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1933-35 Re-armed & conscription      | Germany had a right to re-arm to protect their country |
| 1936 Entered & claimed the Rhineland | The area belonged to Germany until after WW1           |
| 1938-39                              | German speakers in Czechoslovakia were being "oppressed" and should be reunited with Germany                                                       |


#### Munich Pact
Hitler wanted to unite Germany and a region in Czechoslovakia (Sudentenland). He threatened to unlease war.

The **Munich Pact** was signed between Britain, France & Germany where Germany would be given the Sudentenland. In exchange, Hitler agreed it would be his last demand & he would not declare war. Shortly after, the entirety of Czechoslovakia was under German control. 

### Rise Of Fascism & Dictatorships

**Dictator** - Leaders who achieved **absolute power** in their countries.

**Absolute Power** - Total control & use the police, fear, military, & terror to get what they want.

**Fascism**
- Is lead by a dictator
- Creates a militaristic society that uses the army & police to maintain order or limit freedoms
- Promotes extreme nationalism
- Based on racism. Citizens need to be of a certain ethnic group or be labelled enemies of the state.

Fascism was a term created by Benito Mussolini in Italy in 1919.

Symbol of Fascism:

![Fascism](Fascist_symbol.png)

Uses symbol of **STICKS** to represent **CORPORAL** punishment.

Uses symbol of an **AXE** to represent **CAPITAL** punishment.

Together, they represented authority and power (of the empire)

### Treaty Of Versailles

The **Treaty Of Versailles** were the peace terms of WW1. It's terms were created to weaken Germany to ensure they would never wage war again. Harsh terms include the "war guilt clause", demilitarization, & reparations. Many Germans felt angry, fueled by extreme nationalism, had a distrust of other nations, & many wanted revenge.

## Mein Kempf

Adolph Hitler before becoming the fuhrer wrote a manifesto called Mein Kempf (translated to My Struggle). His manifesto criticized the **Treaty of Versailles** & described his ideas how he would restore honour to the German people.

He believed that all Germans needed to be united under 1 leader, the Treaty of Versailles broken, Jewish & Communists were eliminated, and the German people regained respect & were given what they needed & deserved from the international community.

## Nazi Expansion: 1939-1940

### Short Term Cause Of WW2

Britain & France finally drew the line with Poland. They told Hitler that should he invade, they would declare war.

Hitler didn't care and invaded Poland without a declaration of war on Sept 1, 1939.

Within 2 days, Britain & France declared war.

Canada declared war a week later on Sept 10, 1939.

### Germany's Military Advantage

Germany had been preparing & re-arming for 6 years.

Their equipment was more up-to-date

### Blitzkrieg

Germany developed a new military tactic called **Blitzkrieg** (translated to lightning war). It utilized Germany's new tanks & airplanes to launch quick, surprise attacks against the enemy.

It had 4 stages:

#### Air Strikes

Key areas were bombed from the air by the **Luftwaffe**. These included roads, bridges, & command posts.

#### Infantry

Troops were placed in a long line in order to keep the enemy occupied & confused.

#### Mechanized Force

Using the element of surpirse, **panzers** attacted enemies where they least expected.

#### The Main Force

The troops from phase 2 would encircle the enemy as more troops would attack the enemy from behind by gliding over them with prachutes or gliders.

### Polish Invasion

The Germans used the Blitzkrieg tactic. The Polish attempted to fight back but was outclassed by newer, superior equipment. In less than a month, the Germans defeated over 700,000 Polish soldiers & only sustained 14,000 deaths.

### Sitzkrieg (Phoney War)

After Poland was defeated, the German army was sent to protect it's borders through the winter of **1939-1940**. No new attacks were launched.

The Allies declared war but did not take any action. The Fr_nch had a defensive stragey but no offensive strategies. 

This winter break was called Sitzkrieg or the "Phoney War".

### The Maginot Line & The Battle Of Fr_nce

The Fr_nch had build a developed chain of ground-level fortifications along the border with Germany. It was meant to bring "high-tech" advancements to the trench warfare taactics of WW1.

However, Germany pulled a pro gamer move and attacked Fr_nce through Belgium in the spring of 1940. In 10 days, the Germans defeated the Fr_nch and the allies had to retreat to Dunkirk.

Military Stats:

| Germany               | Fr_nce                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 135 Army Divisions    | 104 Army Divisions     |
| 4500 Aircraft         | 2100 Aircraft          |
| 7500 Artillery Pieces | 10000 Artillery Pieces |
| 3800 Panzers          | 2000 Tanks             |

On the beaches, the Allies were under constant attack.

### Operation Dynamo

To rescue their soldiers, Britain rounded up any ship they could spare. It was risky and ships were hit while trying to rescue soldiers.

#### Miracle At Dunkirk

Suddenly, in an unexpected act, the Germans standed down. Hitler had ordered them to stop attacking. This gave the Allies time to evacuate. Between May 26th and June 4th, 330,000 UK troops and 10,000 Fr_nch troops were rescued.

#### Reality Of Dynamo

While this was a rallying point for the war. Losing France was a total military defeat. Evacuations started after 10 days. Approximately 300,000 troops were left behind as POWs. The Fr_nch army lost 40% of it's infantry and 80% of it's equipment.

### France Surrenders

Italy declared war on France on June 12. On June 21st, Fr_nce surrendered after a pitiful 6 weeks of fighting.

*Fun Fact* - Germany being the epic gamer trolls they were made the Fr_nch commander surrender in the exact place, in the exact same train car and same chair as France made Germany surrender in during the end of WW1.

## Canada Was Unprepared

While Fascist governments were doing the fun activity of expanding their empires, Canada wasn't really invested.

This is cause of many reasons:
- Memories of WW1
- Pacifism
- The Greate Depression
- Isolationism
- Canadian Politics & Canadian Unity
- Support for the Policy of Appeasement

There were many reasons Canada eventually joined the war:
- The sinking of the Athenia which had 200 Canadians onboard. One of which being a 10 year old named **Margaret Hayworth**.
- Britain was a notable ally to Canada

## Canada's Homefront

WW2 was a **total war**. This meant all resources were put towards the war effort.

Canada became a major industrial power manufacturing a variety of items from ammunition to aircraft. All industries were involved in supplying materials for the war.

WW2 ended the Great Depression & provided jobs for Canadians.

### Rationing

Everyone was given a **ration book** which outlined how much of each essential good they could purchase. 

Clothing was also rationed as Japan cut off trade of silk which was used for making parachutes & gun powder bags. Silk leg stackings were no long sold as result. **Victory stockings** were instad used being made from yarn and small fibers of silk.

Rationed items were sent to Allied soldiers. This did not affect Canadians as they were used to these conditions because of the Great Depression.

### Victory Bonds & Propaganda

Victory bonds made their return as well as propaganda. Radios were used for messaging and the National Film Board of Canada was created in 1939 to produce propaganda films.

### Canadian-American Relations

Canada and the U.S became best friends (Britain was demoted to good friend) and they agreed to mutual protection. Agreements between Britain, the U.S and Canada protected the Canadian economy.

### British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP)

In late 1939, the BCATP was created. Volunteers came to Canada for air crew training because it was far from military action & fog was rare. Once crews completed training, they could arrive in Britain within 2 weeks. More than 130,000 pilots & crew were trained on Canadian soil. The program was a contributing factor to the Allies' successes in the air.

### Camp X

During 1941-44, Camp X was the first espionage camp in North America. Trained spies were sent to Europe to assist resistance fighters, sabotage, gather info, etc. Their work shortened the war and saved lives.

### Women

Over 35,000 women volunteered in the war. Women were now able to serve as soldiers but not in combat roles. Many women worked as drivers, cooks, nurses, mechanics, messengers, pilots, & radio operators. Nearly 1.5 million worked in various industries in Canada. The idea was to free men up for combat roles.

### Black Canadians

Many Black Canadians who served in WW2 were from Nova Scotia. They were originally dinied but were permitted when recruits were scarce. They could only serve in general positions.

### Indigenous Canadians

8000 FNMI served in the armed forces. They were conscripted even though this violated treaty obligations. The Cree were used as code talkers to prevent the interception of information.

### Chinese Canadians

600 Chinese Canadians served in WW2. They were denied initially but were later seen as useful. This contribution was an important reason why suffrage was extended to them in 1947.

### Sikh Canadians

Khalsa Diwan Society called for community members not to enlist until they gained the right to vote. With this pressue, Asian-Canadians gained the right to vote in 1947.

### Japanese Canadians

In 1941, Japand bombed Pearl Harbour. Canadians started fearing an attack & racism grew towards Japanese Canadians. The PM used the war measures act to restrict Japanese rights in order to gain votes. Over 9 months, 22,000 Japanese Canadians were taken from their homes and placed in internment camps. They had to choose either deportation or relocation. They were forced to leave their possessions behind which were sold off by the government.

### Conscription

In 1939, Mackenzie King promised that there wouldn't be conscription. But volunteers started to dwindle. King held a plebiscite where Canadians voted on Conscription. In 1944, the PM sent 2400 troops by force. This lead to protests across the country including pacifists & Qu__eckers.
