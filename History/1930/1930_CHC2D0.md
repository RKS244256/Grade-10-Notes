## Black Tuesday
**Black Tuesday** (October 29, 1929) refers to the drop in value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's commonly marked as the beginning of the **great depression**. It was a short term cause of the great depression.

## Long Term Causes Of The Great Depression
| Cause                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Businesses Over-expanding                | During the 1920s, companies rapidly expanded. However, they expanded too quickly and when demand slowed, many of these expansions shut down.                                                       |
| Canada's Dependence On Natural Resources | Canada's exports were natural resources and its economy depended on it as a result. When the prices of these resources dropped, Canada would be hit hard as there weren't any other major imports. |
| Canada's Dependence On The US            | 40% of Canada's exports went to the US. 60% of imports were from the US. This linked Canada's economy to the US economy.                                                                           |
| Excessive Use Of Credit                  | Many people bought on credit during the 1920s. Many were lured in by the "buy now, pay later" advertising and lived beyond their means.                                                            |
| Gambling On The Stock Market             | Many saw the stock market as a way to get rich quick during the 1920s. They would invest money they could not afford to lose. This made Black Tuesday devastating to investors.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

- Grass had been replaced for friends.
- Crop prices (their main export) dropped substantially.
- A drought hit the Prairies making growing crops difficult.
- Farmers would not plant many crops and without any grass or crops to hold rainfail, the soil became extremely dry.
- High winds would pick up dry soil creating dust storms. The worst ones were deadly.

- Some were embarrassed and would begin squatting in their own homes.
- Landlords/Banks would get the court to issue an eviction notice.
- Baliffs would then eject these squatters and their belongings.

### Nomads/Homeless
- Some would try to find work/a better life by hitchhiking or **"riding the rails"** (hitching a free ride on a freight train.).
- Some families who lost their homes but still had their cars would live in their cars.

### Bennett's Popularity

- Many Canadians blamed the government for the lack of support & answers.
- They would name things after the PM R.B. Bennett out of hate.

## Politics

### First PM - Mackenzie King
Mackenzie King was the new Liberal Leader in 1919. He became Canada's longest serving PM and was in power from 1921-1945 (except 1926 & 1930-35). He was pro **laissez faire** & was infamous for his **"5 cent speech"** where he claimed he would not give even 5 cents to provinces. This made him unpopular and he lost the vote to R.B. Bennet in the **1930** election.
